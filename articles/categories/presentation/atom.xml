<p>Back in November I was in Paris for <a href="http://www.dotgo.eu/">dotGo</a>, one of my favorite Golang conferences.
I was invited to speak and wanted to share something concrete with the audience, something based on my
experience with <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a> at <a href="https://splice.com">Splice</a>. Go is designed for simplicity
with only one way of doing one thing. That makes preparing talks pretty challenging since a lot has already been said
and there is not much more to add. A lot of us pick Go because it's has concurrency built-in, but it doesn't mean that
writing efficient concurrent code is instinctive or obvious.</p>

<p>I walked the audience through the parallelization of code execution and all the mistakes we usually make.
Using an Arduino and a set of LEDs, I show how goroutines operate and how to write working Go code.</p>

<p>I chose the beautiful city of Medellin, Colombia to say my final goodbye to the awesome Ruby community.
10 years of being part of a community isn't nothing and I took time to reflect on my personal
experience and discuss the future of the language and its community.</p>

in Barcelona, Spain. The talk focuses on:</p>

<ul>
<li>how session authentication works in Ruby on Rails,</li>
<li>the crypto used to protect the data,</li>
<li>the security implications and</li>
<li>how to share the session with applications written in other languages than Ruby (with an example in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>).</li>
</ul>


<p>To illustrate this pretty dry topic, I told the story of Alice and Bob,
two entrepreneurs building a succesful web application and facing some serious challenges.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-14T09:08:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2013/10/14/bad-code-doesnt-exist</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just give a talk at <a href="http://wickedgoodruby.com/">Wicked Good Ruby Conf</a> in Boston. I'm sure the talk will be online soon, but I figured it would be interesting to discuss it a bit further in a blog post.</p>

<p>The format was a bit different than usual, I had a 40 minute slot and
divided in 2, I made my points for 20 minutes and invited two special
guests on stage to discuss the topic. The reason for this format is
because I think we all learn better by looking at things from different
perspectives. I can't thank enough <a href="http://www.sandimetz.com/">Sandi Metz</a> and <a href="http://kytrinyx.com/">Katrina Owen</a> for their contributions.</p>

<p>Here are a few points that I think are interesting and
that we discussed during the talk.</p>

<h2>There isn't such thing as bad code</h2>

<p>Bad code doesn't exist, you have code that can be interpreted/compiled and code that doesn't.
"Good" and "bad" are moralistic designations, not scientific ones.
Let's try to stop using these terms to refer to talk. Let's be more
precise when arguing about code, "what do you mean by bad?" Is it
hard to maintain, hard to understand, slow etc.. ?
Always refer to the context in which the code was written. Don't use it
as an excuse to defend anybody's potentially hurt ego, but instead to
explain why the code was written caring about certain values instead of
others. Most code turns emo after a little while, being able to
understand the context, helps a lot the devision process when facing
such code.</p>

<p><img src="/images/matt_aimonetti-code_apology.jpg" alt="Bad code" /></p>

<h2>It's all about expected outcome and context</h2>

<p>As developers, we aren't paid to write code, we are paid to build
products, to convert ideas into something "concrete". When I use my
favorite app, I don't care that the code is beautiful, I care that it
works, that it's stable and provides me with what I need. If the code is
written in Go, Pascal, Erlang, VB or Ruby doesn't matter at all. That the
code has full test coverage and was written in an agile manner using
weekly scrums and TDD is probably as important as knowing the Pantone
color of a company's logo: it only matters to the people deeply
involved.</p>

<p>Don't focus on how to build, focus on why you build things. Then the how
will come as you learn from others, experiment and discover "how" to build
the "why". The "why" is often the constant, the "how" keeps on changing
as we collect more information.</p>

<h2>We love rules</h2>

<p>When you learn, rules are easier. Katrina made a very good point during
our discussion. When she teaches, she needs to have very strong rules
that she can justify. That said, her rules can change, and as you become
better, you can start challenging the rules. Rules are somewhere between
training wheels and a guard-rail. They are very useful but shouldn't be
used to attack other people.</p>

<p>Ruby has a language doesn't enforce many rules, as a matter of fact,
Matz designed a language so you can set your own rules, or barely have
any rules.
This fact probably explains why so many people are after solid rules
they can rely on. Rules are easy to follow and are a good reference.
The Ruby language doesn't have enough rules to some, so the community is
helping by coming together to define them.
This is by the way, the biggest difference with Python and Go where
these 2 languages explicitly want to only have 1 way of doing one thing.</p>

<h2>Communication and team work</h2>

<p>The key to building a good product (which is what we are paid to do) is
communication. Unfortunately, us developers, are on average, pretty
terrible at that.
We need to do a better job communicating with the rest of the
organization (i.e: anybody who's not an engineer). It usually starts by
the designers. The expected outcome of the product should be clear, well
understood by all and easily evaluable.
Within the engineering team, coding values should be set explicitly.
Not everyone will agree but when we write code, we should all care about
the same overall values so our work is consistent. When something
happens and we have a disagreement, it's easier to refer to our values
to decide what solution to pick.</p>

<p>mruby is Matz’ new Ruby implementation, it’s not cooler than node.js, it doesn’t natively support Hypstermedia,
 it looks just like the good old Ruby. So why should we, as a community care?</p>

<h2>Description of the talk:</h2>

<p>Let's be honest, Ruby became mainstream a few years back and it isn't the cool underground programming language it once was. It's quite likely that your cousin's boyfriend who's "into computers" knows what Ruby on Rails is. There are hundreds of books, conferences, training and meetups for Rubyists. Recruiters fight to hire whoever knows how to generate a scaffolded Rails app. But now cool kids can't stop talking about node.js, CoffeeScript, Clojure, Haskell and pushing code to the UI layer. What does it mean for the new, existing and prospecting Ruby developers? Is it time to jump ship and move on to something else?</p>

<p>Concurrency in Ruby and Python implementations is quite a hot topic
nowadays. In this talk, Matt will explain how concurrency works for a
language that uses a Global Interpreter Lock and it means concretely.
Finally Aimonetti will also cover Ruby's garbage collector (GC)
and why it's important to understand how automatic memory
management works to get better performance out of your code.</p>

<p>Programming languages, such as Ruby, are natural and elegant. But to achieve this elegance, things have to happen under the hood. Garbage Collection, concurrency, Global Interpreter Lock, metaprogramming, C extensions are just some of the things happening with or without our knowledge. Trying to understand these concepts, their implementations and their implications in daily coding might seem daunting. However, having a good understanding of these topics will make you a better developer. No CS degree or PhD required to attend this talk.</p>

<p>At the end of the talk, Matz (Ruby's creator) came on stage to answer
some questions related to what was explained.</p>

<h2>Details of the talk content</h2>

<p>MacRuby is currently at version 0.7.1 and version 0.8 is in preparation.
Since last new a lot of things happened, here is a quick summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cocoa dev is now considered stable.  Apple gave its seal of approval, most of the bugs are fixed and it's currently used on production projects and some apps were even submitted to the Mac App Store.</p></li>
<li><p>Ahead of Time compilation. This is quite a major improvement with many repercussions. Being to compile your Ruby source code means faster boot time and source obfuscation. Two major things to consider when you want to ship a desktop app.</p></li>
<li><p>Debugger. MacRuby now ships with its own debugger. Of course you can still use GDB and DTrace, but MacRuby's debugger is really easy to use and very powerful.</p></li>
<li><p>Grand Central Dispatch support and wrapper API. Having to manage threads can be hard for both developers and for the machines having to run the developer code. GCD is an abstraction layer allowing developers to only focus on business logic without having to worry about the underlying details if you don't want to. The end result is an optimum use of all the cores available on a machine and truly concurrent code. Two important notions when writing desktop apps.</p></li>
<li><p>ControlTower - A webserver for Rack apps written in MacRuby and using GCD for concurrency.</p></li>
<li><p>New rewritten and more efficient dispatcher. Practically that means that the dispatcher is now thread safe with a per thread cache.</p></li>
<li><p>RegExp lib switch from Oniguruma to ICU. This was quite a big change and it was required because Oniguruma isn't thread safe and while C Ruby uses a Global Interpreter Lock. MacRuby on the other hand uses native POSIX threads running on their own non-locking, reentrant VM making thread safety critical.</p></li>
<li><p>More solid foundations - Some key classes we rewritten to improve performance and flexibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for C blocks - Objective-C has been supporting C blocks for a while and some Cocoa APIs require the use of blocks. MacRuby now allows you to use Ruby blocks and to pass them as C blocks. (new BridgeSupport required)</p></li>
<li><p>Sandboxing - For safety reasons, MacRuby allows you to now sandbox your applications. You can restrict your app from doing some potential dangerous things such as writing to disk, calling the system, accessing internet etc...</p></li>
<li><p>Mac App Store - This is not something done by the MacRuby team. But it directly affects MacRuby developers wanting to distribute their applications. Think about the exposure that you can app can have. Even if you have a web app, you can use WebKit to wrap it up, hook up a notification, add to that a local backup solution and geo location. Brilliant way to provide an even better user experience and better product exposure. All that really easily if you already know Ruby.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>To give an idea of what can be done I showed some code samples hopefully showing the cool hacking things one can play with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first demo shows how to use the speech recognizer. The example is really sample you speak the name of someone and his/her picture shows up on screen. Just a few lines of code and you can start screaming commands to your TV to get it to change channel.</p></li>
<li><p>The second demo is an extremely simple Gowala client using CoreLocation. Yes, Mac desktop and laptops support geo location.</p></li>
<li><p>Another example of what you do is a sample letting you import all your twitter followers to your address book.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also use some of the low level OS features such as the Tokenizer. The next example showed how to extend Ruby and use a C function to detect the language of a string.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the last demo shows how to integrate a bluetooth device to control a HTML view via MacRuby and Javascript. All that in just a few lines of code!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Basically, MacRuby is now mature and it's time for hackers and people trying to get exposure to give it a try.</p>

Aimonetti gave a talk entitled <em></em>.</p>

<h2>Description of the talk:</h2>

<p>For many years, Apple has been shipping its OS with Ruby. But starting about two years ago, Apple started developing their own Ruby implementation on top of Objective-C runtime for performance and compatibility reasons. A developer can already write a fully native and compiled Cocoa application only using the Ruby language and the Cocoa API. But MacRuby is more than an Objective-C replacement, it allows developers to push the traditional boundaries of desktop/mobile applications &amp; games by offering easy integration of web services, creation of p2p application, native GUI for backends web application, reuse of code and much more.</p>

<p>During his talk, Matt Aimonetti, MacRuby team member, will explain the state of the project, its goal and potential as well as show concrete examples of how to use this powerful new Ruby implementation.</p>

Aimonetti gave a talk entitled <em>Rails for the non Ruby developers</em>.</p>

<h2>Description of the talk:</h2>

<p>Unless you have been living on a different planet for the last few years, you have more than likely heard of Ruby on Rails.
You have probably heard good and bad things about it, and might even have watched some of the famous screencasts.
The thing is, you don't really know that much about Ruby and are not sure that it is worth learning yet another programming language and a new framework.
With companies like Apple, Microsoft and Sun investing in Ruby, you might be surprised by how easy the transition can be.</p>

<p>Matt will show you the pros and cons of using Rails. He'll go through some of the myths around the framework and explain why it might be a better fit than you would expect.</p>

<p>Are you a developer who would love to get into video games but get scared when he hears "OpenGL" or "rendering engines"? Or Maybe, you never considered writing a video game because you have heard Ruby was slow and you are not ready to give up on your favorite programming language. This talk is for you then. Together, we will build a very simple game using Ruby and the development tools offered by Apple. At the end of the presentation you will be ready to get started on your own project.</p>

<h2>Blog post</h2>

<p>I have had the opportunity to go to and speak at many conferences but this year was the first time I had the chance to go to <a href="http://railssummit.com.br">RailsSummit</a> in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>

<p>I was really looking forward to this trip and I have to say it went beyond my expectations. I had heard really good things from people such as the <a href="http://www.phusion.nl/">Phusion guys</a> (Ninh &amp; Hongli), Gregg Pollack and others.</p>

<p>For those who don't know, RailsSummit is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, Ruby event in Latin America. It's organized yearly by <a href="http://www.locaweb.com.br/">Locaweb</a>, the #1 hosting company in Brazil (props to Akita &amp; Cristiane for their work).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2761/4027342992_789777fd03_m_d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As part of my involvement in the Ruby community I have met a lot of Brazilians always willing to help and especially giving time to translate content. (A good example would be the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/pt/start">Portuguese version of the Rails wiki</a> or <a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/">José Valim</a> GSOC contribution) However, I did not realize how fast Rails was growing over here.</p>

<p>To come back to the conference, I have to say it was one of the best conference I have gone to. Chad Fowler, who gave the opening keynote, later told me that it reminded him of the first Ruby conferences in the US . For me, what made a huge difference was the fact that it was a very positive conference. People were happy to be here, eager to share and you could feel the passion. Unfortunately, I missed the first few Ruby conferences, but I can totally imagine how must have been. Passionate people, not trying to push their products but instead, share the cool stuff they've been working on. This is exactly the feeling I had during this conference.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because I don't understand Portuguese well enough or maybe it's just a cultural thing, but the people at the conference were just super friendly and always willing to help. I was really glad to meet those who have been using some of my work, some new people to Ruby and people who don't do Ruby but were just interested in knowing what was going on in the Ruby world.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2719/4027357802_1082f38090.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The schedule was pretty packed and the discussions very interesting, you could certainly feel the excitement in the air. Ruby seems to catching up quickly over there. Brazilian Rubyists seem to be very pragmatic and a good illustration of that was certainly made by <a href="http://improveit.com.br/en">Vinicus Teles</a>, Brazil Agile XPert, who shared tips on how to release a successful product.</p>

<p>I stayed a few days after the conference and went to visit the Rubyists in Rio. Rio is a great city. It has some of the best soccer players in the world and some seriously talented software developers. Ruby &amp; Rails are not just the new trendy startup secret to success, companies like globo.com, currently the largest TV network in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America">Latin America</a> and the fourth largest in the world, also started using Ruby and Rails. I had the opportunity to visit their office and meet their teams. It's very exciting to see how they use Agile/XP and Ruby and how they seem to be so successful. But I will keep that for another post.</p>

<p>Overall, even though the actual traveling to/from Brazil was a bit long, RailsSummit was a blast. I really hope to be able to come back next year, and by then, hopefully my Portuguese will have improved.</p>

Aimonetti gave a talk entitled <em>Rails 3: Stepping off of the golden path</em>.</p>

<h2>Description of the talk:</h2>

<p>Back in December 2008, the Rails and Merb core teams surprised everybody by deciding to merge their teams and focus their energy on a common release: Rails 3.0. On one hand, Rails is famous for being an opinionated Rapid Application Development framework following the well known “convention over configuration” design paradigm. On the other hand, Merb is known for its performance, extreme modularity and greenfield experimentations. The new unified team is working on having the best of both worlds, but the real questions are:</p>

<p>How does that affect me as a Ruby/Rails/Merb developer? When should I step off of the golden path and why?</p>

<p>Matt Aimonetti, Merb core and Rails team member will take you through the new world of possibilities now available to Rails 3.0 developers. You will see the pros and cons of different options for people desiring to step off the “golden path”. Matt will show concrete examples of application/cases where alternative solutions could be more appropriate and others where you are better off staying on the golden path</p>

<h2>Blog post</h2>

<p>RailsConf 2009 has now finished.  This time last year, no one would have ever guessed that the Merb and Rails teams would join forces and focus on what will hopefully be known as one of the best Web Frameworks.</p>

<p>It was encouraging to see so many people excited about what's being ported over from Merb and the new options available to people who are currently limited by the existing stack. For those interested in pushing Rails further and doing stuff out of the norm, here are my slides. <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/5919-arthur-zapparoli">Arthur Zapparoli</a> from <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.pro.br/">Brazilian Rails squad</a> recorded most of the talk and told me he will upload the video ASAP. You can also read <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2009/05/08/railsconf-wrapup/">Yehuda Katz' blog</a> which covers what he talked about.</p>

<p>It was really great to meet a lot of new people as well as people I only knew via IRC/IM/twitter.</p>

<p>It was a great honor to finally meet <a href="http://twitter.com/dkubb">Dan Kubb</a> (DataMapper), <a href="http://twitter.com/ninh">Ninh Hernandez-Búi</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/phusion_nl">Hongli McLovin Lai (Phusion)</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/peterc">Peter Cooper</a> (<a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/">RubyInside</a>), <a href="http://twitter.com/rsim">Raimonds Simanovskis</a> (Oracle adapter for AR), <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arungupta/">Arun Gupta</a> (Sun/Glassfish),  <a href="http://twitter.com/copiousfreetime">Jeremy Hinegardner</a> (crate), <a href="http://maximilien.org">Michael Maxilien</a> (IBM), Dana Jones (<a href="http://railsbridge.org/">railsbridge</a>), Zach Zolton &amp; Geoff Buesing (CouchRest) and of course the Brazilian crew (lots of awesome .br guys came this year, I'm looking forward to RailsSummit) and last but not least, the French speaking crew (I'm glad to see Ruby is picking up back home). (I know I'm forgetting people... sorry about that)</p>

<p>It was also really nice to chat with some domain experts like Dave Astels, Aslak Hellesøy, Rich Kilmer, David Chelimsky, Ryan Brown, Derek Neighbors etc.. to get their feedback on various projects I'm working on.</p>

<p>Leaving Vegas, I feel like the Rails community is expanding quickly (it was the first RailsConf for 1/4 to 1/5 of the attendees) and that the community is organizing itself to welcome a new audience (better documentation, great initiatives like <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">railsbridge.org</a>, willingness to help), as well as trying to be more available to the 'Enterprise' world.</p>

<p>These feelings were enforced during our Rails Activism BOF and after talking with 3rd party developers and sponsors really trying to solve problems that newcomers to Rails are now facing. This is an exciting time.</p>
