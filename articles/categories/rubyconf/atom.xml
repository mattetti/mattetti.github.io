Aimonetti gave a talk entitled <em>Ruby: time to move on</em>.</p>

<h2>Description of the talk:</h2>

<p>Let's be honest, Ruby became mainstream a few years back and it isn't the cool underground programming language it once was. It's quite likely that your cousin's boyfriend who's "into computers"¬ù knows what Ruby on Rails is. There are hundreds of books, conferences, training and meetups for Rubyists. Recruiters fight to hire whoever knows how to generate a scaffolded Rails app. But now cool kids can't stop talking about node.js, CoffeeScript, Clojure, Haskell and pushing code to the UI layer. What does it mean for the new, existing and prospecting Ruby developers? Is it time to jump ship and move on to something else?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During <a href="http://rubyconfargentina.org/en">RubyConf Argentina 2011</a> in Buenos Aires, Argentina Matt
Aimonetti gave a talk entitled <em>Inside Ruby: concurrency &amp; garbage collection explained</em>.</p>

<h2>Description of the talk:</h2>

<p>Concurrency in Ruby and Python implementations is quite a hot topic
nowadays. In this talk, Matt will explain how concurrency works for a
language that uses a Global Interpreter Lock and it means concretely.
Finally Aimonetti will also cover Ruby's garbage collector (GC)
and why it's important to understand how automatic memory
management works to get better performance out of your code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf 2011</a> in New Orleans, LA Matt
Aimonetti gave a talk entitled <em>Complex Ruby concepts simplified</em>.</p>

<h2>Description of the talk:</h2>

<p>Programming languages, such as Ruby, are natural and elegant. But to achieve this elegance, things have to happen under the hood. Garbage Collection, concurrency, Global Interpreter Lock, metaprogramming, C extensions are just some of the things happening with or without our knowledge. Trying to understand these concepts, their implementations and their implications in daily coding might seem daunting. However, having a good understanding of these topics will make you a better developer. No CS degree or PhD required to attend this talk.</p>

<p>At the end of the talk, Matz (Ruby's creator) came on stage to answer
some questions related to what was explained.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf 2009</a> in San Francisco, CA Matt
Aimonetti gave a talk entitled <em>Writing 2D games for the OSX platform in Ruby</em>.</p>

<h2>Description of the talk:</h2>

<p>Are you a developer who would love to get into video games but get scared when he hears "OpenGL" or "rendering engines"? Or Maybe, you never considered writing a video game because you have heard Ruby was slow and you are not ready to give up on your favorite programming language. This talk is for you then. Together, we will build a very simple game using Ruby and the development tools offered by Apple. At the end of the presentation you will be ready to get started on your own project.</p>
