is really easy to learn due to its small scope.
If you have some coding experience, you will be able to have fully working code
in a matter of minutes otherwise you might want to read <a href="http://www.golangbootcamp.com/">my free book</a> (WIP).</p>

<p>Very much like with many other programming languages, a challenging part
of Go is to learn how to write idiomatic code.
The good news is that Go makes refactoring easy (and already has a lot
of conventions).
I strongly recommend <a href="http://peter.bourgon.org/go-in-production/">this post</a> from Peter Bourgon about Go at SoundCloud and
the extra conventions they follow (<a href="https://splice.com">Splice</a> also
follows the same conventions).</p>

<p>One of my favorite Go projects is the <a href="http://gobot.io">gobot</a> project
by <a href="http://hybridgroup.com/">HybridGroup</a>.</p>

</div>


<p>The Gobot project is pretty young and I noticed a few things that
could be improved so I offered my help to <a href="https://twitter.com/deadprogram">Ron</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/adzankich">Adrian</a> and the rest of the team.
Our discussion quickly turned into a fun group refactoring
session (featuring <a href="https://twitter.com/kytrinyx">@kytrinyx</a>,

</div>


<h2>Packages</h2>

<p>Gobot is split into multiple packages, a core and a few other packages.
The gobot team, out of habit chose to put a package per repo.
After further discussions, we chose to bring all official packages
inside the same repo to keep things easier and to keep the import paths
clean and logical.</p>

<p>So instead of having:</p>

<p><code>
github.com/hybridgroup/gobot
github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-sphero
github.com/hybridgroup/gobot-...
</code></p>

<p>All the none-core packages are moved to subdirectories:</p>

<p><code>
github.com/hybridgroup/gobot
github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/sphero
github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/...
</code></p>

<p>This also allowed us to fix the package names
<code>gobot-sphero</code> is now simply <code>sphero</code></p>

<p>Which also allowed us to simplify the following code:</p>

<p>From:
```go
type SpheroAdaptor struct {</p>

<pre><code>gobot.Adaptor
sp io.ReadWriteCloser
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>To</p>

<p><code>go
type Adaptor struct {
  gobot.Adaptor
  sp io.ReadWriteCloser
}
</code></p>

<p>We did that with a few other types and methods all over the packages.</p>

<p>We had a discussion about what lead to the multiple repos vs
one repo. There are legitimate cases for both approaches but in this
situation, the decision was based on a misunderstanding. The author
thought that by importing the top package, all sub packages would
also be somewhat included in the build, making the binary bigger than
needed. Since Go only compiles and links packages imported, moving all
packages within the same repo wouldn't change the binary output.
Note that this is not because in this specific case we have all packages
in the same repo that this is the right thing to do every single time.</p>

<h2>doc.go</h2>

<p>By conventions, package should contain a <code>doc.go</code> file that contains
an overview of the package and often some information so the developer
trying to use the library can find the right entry points.</p>

<p>As usual, the standard libraries are a good example,
<a href="http://golang.org/src/pkg/net/http/doc.go">here is the net/http <code>doc.go</code> file</a>.</p>

<h2>Using a constructor</h2>

<p>We spent some time refactoring <code>master.go</code> which is the file implementing
the code handling one or multiple robots (which can each have multiple devices).</p>

<p>The original function code looked like this:</p>

<p><code>go
func GobotMaster() *Master {
  m := new(Master)
  m.NumCPU = runtime.NumCPU()
  return m
}
</code></p>

<p>There are a few things that aren't really idiomatic in this code.
The first thing is that by convention, constructors are usually called <code>New&lt;Type&gt;</code>.
Secondly, the <a href="http://peter.bourgon.org/go-in-production/">community seems to follow</a> the following stylistic choice:
only use <code>new</code> and <code>make</code> when you need to set the capacity (<code>make([]string,3)</code>)
Finally we don't need to allocate a variable. Here is the refactored code:</p>

<p><code>go
func NewMaster() *Master {
  return &amp;Master{NumCPU: runtime.NumCPU()}
}
</code></p>

<h2>Cleanup package vars</h2>

<p>In the original code, we had a variable called <code>trap</code> which was
a function living at the top level of the package:</p>

<p><code>go
var trap = func(c chan os.Signal) {
  signal.Notify(c, os.Interrupt)
}
</code></p>

<p>The func was then used to handle signals. The author
chose to use a variable so he could mutate it in the test suite and
avoid sending an interrupt when testing.
We realized we could avoid having this function variable at the top of the package by moving
it as a field on the <code>Master</code> type and setting the default func in the constructor.</p>

<p>```go
func NewMaster() *Master {</p>

<pre><code>return &amp;Master{
    NumCPU: runtime.NumCPU(),
    trap: func(c chan os.Signal) {
        signal.Notify(c, os.Interrupt)
    },
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The code still behaves the same and we can still overwrite the trap function in our tests
(since the tests are part of the same packge, the non exported field is available)
but we got rid of a top level var.</p>

<h2>Reading from a channel</h2>

<p>The following code was ranging over a predefined channel (<code>c</code>) of signals.
and when a signal would arrive, all robots belonging to the master
would be halted and disconnected.</p>

<p>```go
for _ = range c {
  for r := range m.Robots {</p>

<pre><code>m.Robots[r].haltDevices()
m.Robots[r].finalizeConnections()
</code></pre>

<p>  }
  break
}
```</p>

<p>The code above works well but could be cleaned up a little:</p>

<p>```go
// waiting on something coming on the channel
&lt;- c
for _, r := range m.Robots {</p>

<pre><code>r.haltDevices()
r.finalizeConnections()
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This code does the same thing but simpler.
We are trying to read from the channel which will block
(we don't care about the result so we don't capture or could have used an underscore).
Then we loop through each robot and stop them.
We managed to remove a for loop on the channel (with an odd break)
and made the code intent clearer.</p>

<h2>Chainable functions and typed nils</h2>

<p>Next, we tackled the following method:</p>

<p>```go
func (m <em>Master) FindRobotDevice(name string, device string) </em>device {</p>

<pre><code>robot := m.FindRobot(name)
if robot != nil {
    return robot.GetDevice(device)
}
return nil
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The funny thing about this method is that it's not needed.
We could get the same result by calling:</p>

<p><code>go
m.FindRobot("bot name").GetDevice("laser")
</code></p>

<p>When I said that, someone suggested that it might be a bad idea
since <code>FindRobot()</code> might return <code>nil</code> and now we would be calling
<code>GetDevice()</code> on <code>nil</code> and bad things would happen.
Looking at the code, it was actually easy to fix.</p>

<p>Here is the original code:</p>

<p>```go
func (r <em>Robot) GetDevice(name string) </em>device {</p>

<pre><code>for _, device := range r.devices {
    if device.Name == name {
        return device
    }
}
return nil
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Here is the refactored version:</p>

<p>```go
func (r <em>Robot) GetDevice(name string) </em>device {</p>

<pre><code>if r == nil {
    return nil
}
for _, device := range r.devices {
    if device.Name == name {
        return device
    }
}
return nil
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Did you spot the difference? We just added a check to see if the pointer (<code>r</code>)
was nil, if it is, we just return <code>nil</code>.
When I added the code above, the person who was worried
about calling <code>GetDevice()</code> on <code>nil</code> was scratching his head.</p>

<p>Golang does something very interesting (and a bit surprising if you come
from a dynamic language),
it returns a nil pointer of the type we defined as return type.
Let's walk through the code by rewriting it slightly differently:</p>

<p><code>go
var bot *Robot
bot = m.FindRobot("unknown name")
</code></p>

<p>At this point if <code>FindRobot()</code> didn't find a robot, <code>bot</code> is still
of type <code>*Robot</code> but the pointer is nil.
Because we defined a method <code>GetDevice()</code> on <code>*Robot</code>, we
can call:</p>

<p><code>go
bot.GetDevice("x-ray")
</code></p>

<p>The <code>GetDevice()</code> method will execute and will return <code>nil</code> right
away because we check if the pointer is <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>The fact that nil pointers have types has 2 important implications,
the first one is that you can nicely chain methods without
checking at the caller site if the returned value is <code>nil</code>.
The second is that your methods should expect to be potentially
called on a nil pointer and should properly handle such cases.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Go team member <a href="https://twitter.com/enneff">Andrew Gerrand</a>
suggested on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7667554">Hacker News</a>
to name the method <code>Device</code> instead of <code>GetDevice</code>. The word <code>Get</code> is almost always redundant.
In the same chain of thoughts, maybe we should rename <code>FindRobot</code> just <code>Robot</code>.</p>

<h2>Collection types / type aliasing</h2>

<p>I'm writing this post on my way back from GopherCon and there
was one more thing I wanted to clean up and share with you.
This is a nice pattern I use often to simplify my code.</p>

<p>Our <code>Robot</code> type has a <code>connections</code> field and a <code>devices</code> field:</p>

<p>```go
type Robot struct {
  // .. fields removed to simplify the example</p>

<pre><code>devices       []*device
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>To avoid always having to manually loop through the slice, a method is defined on
pointers to <code>Robot</code>. This method iterates over
the devices and halts them:</p>

<p>```go
func (r *Robot) haltDevices() {</p>

<pre><code>for _, device := range r.devices {
    device.Halt()
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This code is totally fine but from an API design perspective, wouldn't it be nicer
to use?:</p>

<p><code>go
r.devices().Halt()
</code></p>

<p>One of the nice things with this approach is that the concept of halting, which
really belongs to the devices, doesn't need to leak into the <code>Robot</code> world.</p>

<p>To implement the suggested API change, we need to define a <a href="http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book/methods_and_interfaces#uid90">type alias</a>:</p>

<p><code>go
type DeviceCollection []*device
</code></p>

<p>We can now define methods on our new type:</p>

<p>```go
func (c DeviceCollection) Halt() {
  for _, device := range c {</p>

<pre><code>device.Halt()
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>We then need to update our <code>Robot</code> type:</p>

<p><code>go
type Robot struct {
  // .. fields removed to simplify the example
  devices       DeviceCollection
}
</code></p>

<p>And we are done with our refactoring.</p>

<p>One last note, since we might need to call different methods on our collection
we could create an iterator method.</p>

<p>```go
func (c DeviceCollection) Each(f func(*device)) {
  for _, d := range c {</p>

<pre><code>f(d)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}</p>

<p>// which can be called like so
r.devices.Each(func(d *device){
  d.Halt()
})
```</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Needless to say that we had fun. The refactoring went much further
and we removed the use of reflections, some sleeps and much more.
The code is going through a nice cleanup before reaching 1.0 and
I can only encourage everybody to play with <a href="http://gobot.io">Gobot</a>,
there are very few things as fun as Go and Robots!
(The code is open sourced, look at it, add new drivers, send PRs!)</p>

<p>I'd like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/deadprogram">Ron Evans</a> and the <a href="http://hybridgroup.com/">Hybrid Group</a>
for  open sourcing their code and sharing the fun with all of us.
I can't wait for the next LA Go + Robot hack night.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://splice.com">Splice</a> is hiring, our stack uses a lot of
different technologies but our backend is all in Go and we are always
looking for talented engineers. Drop me a line if interested.</p>

    <updated>2013-07-01T22:28:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>https://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2013/07/01/golang-multipart-file-upload-example</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Go language is one of my favorite programming languages. However,
sometimes doing simple things can seem a bit harder than it should.
However, most of the time, the problem is just to find out how to
do things the easy way. While Go's documention isn't bad, the real key
to finding out how to do things is often to look at the <a href="http://golang.org/src/pkg/mime/multipart/">source code</a> and
the <a href="http://golang.org/src/pkg/mime/multipart/multipart_test.go">test suite</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not yet super familiar with all the std lib packages, so when I
wanted to test my Go web services, I wrote a few lines of code to create
a multipart file upload function that was building the body from scratch.
Once I was done messing with the various headers, boundary protocol etc..
I started testing some edge cases, I found some bugs in my code.
Looking at Go's packages, I realized that all the tools were already
available for me to use. I was just lacking a good example. Walking
through the test suite I finally figured out how to write a simple
multipart file upload example with some extra query params.</p>

<p>Hopefully this example will be helpful to some of you.</p>

<p>```go
package main</p>

<p>import (</p>

<pre><code>"bytes"
"fmt"
"io"
"log"
"mime/multipart"
"net/http"
"os"
"path/filepath"
</code></pre>

<p>)</p>

<p>// Creates a new file upload http request with optional extra params
func newfileUploadRequest(uri string, params map[string]string, paramName, path string) (*http.Request, error) {</p>

<pre><code>file, err := os.Open(path)
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
defer file.Close()

body := &amp;bytes.Buffer{}
writer := multipart.NewWriter(body)
part, err := writer.CreateFormFile(paramName, filepath.Base(path))
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
_, err = io.Copy(part, file)

for key, val := range params {
    _ = writer.WriteField(key, val)
}
err = writer.Close()
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}

req, err := http.NewRequest("POST", uri, body)
req.Header.Set("Content-Type", writer.FormDataContentType())
return req, err
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>func main() {</p>

<pre><code>path, _ := os.Getwd()
path += "/test.pdf"
extraParams := map[string]string{
    "title":       "My Document",
    "author":      "Matt Aimonetti",
    "description": "A document with all the Go programming language secrets",
}
request, err := newfileUploadRequest("https://google.com/upload", extraParams, "file", "/tmp/doc.pdf")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
client := &amp;http.Client{}
resp, err := client.Do(request)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
} else {
    body := &amp;bytes.Buffer{}
    _, err := body.ReadFrom(resp.Body)
if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
resp.Body.Close()
    fmt.Println(resp.StatusCode)
    fmt.Println(resp.Header)
    fmt.Println(body)
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/mattetti/5914158">Example's source code on GitHub</a></p>

<p>All the work is done in the <code>newfileUploadRequest</code> function and
really, the <code>mime/multipart</code> package hides all the complexity of
creating a multipart request.</p>

<p>The key is to set a new <code>multipart.Writer</code>:</p>

<p><code>go
writer := multipart.NewWriter(body)
</code></p>

<p>The writer will do all the work and will write directly to our body (which itself is a buffer of bytes).</p>

<p>We then create a part for the file form entry with the name of the file
param and the name of the file (that we extracted using the <code>path/filepath</code>
package).
We need to add the content of the file to the file part, we use the
<code>io.Copy()</code> to do so. In the first version of this article, I had used
<code>io/ioutil</code> <code>Readall</code> to read the content of the file (see code <a href="https://gist.github.com/mattetti/5914158/f4d1393d83ebedc682a3c8e7bdc6b49670083b84">here</a>).
However a few readers rightfully mentioned that I should instead copy
content from the file to the part instead of temporarily loading the content of
the file in memory. <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/eEFBMGMNTW">Here</a> is an
even more optimized version using goroutine to stream the data, and
<a href="https://github.com/gebi/go-fileupload-example/blob/master/main.go">here</a> is the full example using a pipe.</p>

<p><code>go
part, _ := writer.CreateFormFile(paramName, filepath.Base(path))
_, err = io.Copy(part, file)
</code></p>

<p>The <code>multipart.Writer</code> takes care of setting the boundary and formating
the form data for us, nice isn't it?!</p>

<p>Then for any extra params passed as a map of string keys to string
value, we use another function of the <code>multipart.Writer</code> type:</p>

<p><code>go
writer.WriteField(key, val)
</code></p>

<p>Once again, the writer takes care of creating the right headers, and to
add the passed value.</p>

<p>At this point, we just need to close our writer and use our body to
create a new request.</p>

<p><code>go
writer.Close()
req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", uri, body)
</code></p>

<p>One last thing before triggering our request, we need to set the header
that contains the content type including the boundary being used.
Once again, the Go lib has us covered:</p>

<p><code>go
req.Header.Add("Content-Type", writer.FormDataContentType())
</code></p>

<p>As a reference, here is the generated body:</p>

<p>Golang might not be as high level as Ruby or Python, but it's not too
far off and it certainly comes with some great std libs.
I know I recently caught myself writing a lot of small scripts in Go,
something I used to do in Ruby. I think this is mainly due to the
fact that Go is compiled, designed for concurrency, has great std libs and
is quite easy to write.</p>

    <id>https://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2013/06/26/practical-guide-to-graphite-monitoring</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Engineers love to improve things. Refactoring and optimizations
drive us. There is just a slight problem: we often do that in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Before optimizing, we need to <strong>measure</strong>.</p>

<p>Without a solid baseline, how can you say that the time you invested in making things better wasn't a total waste?</p>

<p>True refactoring is done with a solid test suite in place. Developers know that their code behavior didn't change while they cleaned things up. Performance optimization is the same thing: we need a good set of metrics before changing anything.</p>

<p>There are plenty of monitoring tools out there, each with its own pros
and cons. The point of this article isn't to argue about which one <strong>you</strong> should use,
but instead to give you the some practical knowledge about <a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview.html">Graphite</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/graphite_fullscreen_800.png" alt="Screenshot of the Graphite UI" /></p>

<p>Graphite is used to store and render time-series data. In other words,
you collect metrics and Graphite allows you to create pretty graphs easily.</p>

<p>During my time at LivingSocial, I relied on Graphite to
understand trends, issues and optimize performance. As my coworkers
and I were discussing my recently announced departure, I asked them how I
could help them during the transition period. Someone mentioned creating a
Graphite cheatsheet. The cheatsheet turned into something much bigger than I expected
and LivingSocial was nice enough to let me publicly publish this
short guide.</p>

<p><em>For a more in depth dive into the statsd/graphite features, look at
<a href="http://blog.pkhamre.com/2012/07/24/understanding-statsd-and-graphite/">this blog post</a></em></p>

<h2>Organizing metrics</h2>

<p>There are <a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tools.html">many ways</a> to feed Graphite,
I personally used <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/">Etsy's statsd</a> (node.js daemon) which was being fed
via the <a href="https://github.com/reinh/statsd">statsd RubyGem</a>.
The gem allows developers to push recorded metrics to a statsd server
via UDP. Using UDP instead of TCP makes the metrics collection operation
non blocking which means that while you might theoretically lose a few samples, your
instrumented code performance shouldn't be affected. (Read <a href="http://codeascraft.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/">Etsy's
blog post</a> to know more about
why they chose UDP).</p>

<p><strong> Tip </strong>: Doing DNS resolution on each call can be a bit expensive (a
few ms), target your statsd server using its ip or use Ruby's <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/resolv/rdoc/Resolv/DNS.html#method-i-getaddress">resolv</a>
standard library to only do the lookup once at initialization.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>I'm skipping the config settings about storage retention, resolution etc.. see the
<a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview.html">manual</a> for more info.</em></p>

<h3>Namespacing</h3>

<p>Always namespace your collected data, even if you only have one app for
now. If your app does two things at the same time like serving HTML and
providing an API, you might want to create two clients which you would namespace
differently.</p>

<h3>Naming metrics</h3>

<p>Properly naming your metrics is critical to avoid conflicts,
confusing data and potentially wrong interpretation later on.
I like to organize metrics using the following schema:</p>

<p><code>
 &lt;namespace&gt;.&lt;instrumented section&gt;.&lt;target (noun)&gt;.&lt;action (past tense verb)&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><code>
accounts.authentication.password.attempted
accounts.authentication.password.succeeded
accounts.authentication.password.failed
</code></p>

<p>I use nouns to define the target and past tense verbs to define
the action. This becomes a useful convention when you need to nest
metrics. In the above example, let's say I want to monitor the reasons for
the failed password authentications. Here is how I would organize the
extra stats:</p>

<p><code>
accounts.authentication.password.failure.no_email_found
accounts.authentication.password.failure.password_check_failed
accounts.authentication.password.failure.password_reset_required
</code></p>

<p>As you can see, I used <code>failure</code> instead of <code>failed</code> in the stat name.
The main reason is to avoid conflicting data. <code>failed</code> is an action and
already has a data series allocated, if I were to add nested data using
<code>failed</code>, the data would be collected but the result would be confusing.
The other reason is because when we will graph the data, we will often
want to use a wildcard <code>*</code> to collect all nested data in a series.</p>

<p>Graphite wild card usage example on counters:</p>

<p><code>
accounts.authentication.password.failure.*
</code></p>

<p>This should give us the same value as <code>accounts.authentication.password.failed</code>,
 so really, we should just collect the more detailed version and get rid
of <code>accounts.authentication.password.failed</code>.</p>

<p>Following this naming convention should really help your data stay clean and
easy to manage.</p>

<h2>Counters and metrics</h2>

<p>StatsD lets you record different types of metrics <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/blob/master/docs/metric_types.md">as illustrated here</a>.</p>

<p>This article will focus on the 2 main types:</p>

<ul>
<li>counters</li>
<li>timers</li>
</ul>


<p>Use counters for metrics when you don't care about how long the code
your are instrumenting takes to run. Usually counters are used for data
that have more of a direct business value. Examples include sales,
authentication, signups, etc.</p>

<p>Timers are more powerful because they can be used to analyze the time
spent in a piece of code but also be used as a counters. Most of my work
involves timers because I want to detect system anomalies including performance
changes and trends in the way code is being used.</p>

<p>I usually use timers in a nested manner, starting when a request
comes into the system, through each of the various
datastores, and ending with the response.</p>

<h2>Monitoring response time</h2>

<p>It's a well known fact that the response time of your application will
both affect the user's emotional experience and their likelihood of completing a transactin.
However understanding where time is being spent within a request is
hard, especially when the problems aren't obvious. Tools like
<a href="http://newrelic.com/">NewRelic</a> will often get you a good overview of
how your system behave but they also lack the granularity you might
need. For instance NewRelic aggregates and averageses the data client side
before sending it to their servers. While this is fine in a lot of cases,
if you care about more than averages and want more detailed metrics, you probably need
to run your own solution such as statsd + graphite.</p>

<p>I build most of my web-based APIs on <a href="https://github.com/mattetti/wd-sinatra">wd_sinatra</a> which
has a <code>pre_dispatch_hook</code> method which method is executed before a
request is dispatched.</p>

<p>I use this hook to both set the "Stats context" in the current thread and extract the client name based on HTTP headers.
If you don't use WD, I'll show how to do the same thing in a
Rack middleware.</p>

<p><code>ruby
def pre_dispatch_hook
  api_client = extract_api_client_name(env)
  Thread.current[:stats_context] = "#{api_client}.http.#{env['wd.service'].verb}.#{env['wd.service'].url}".gsub('/', '.')
  # [...]
end
</code></p>

<p>Then using Sinatra's global before/after filters, we set a unique
request id and start a timer that we stop and report in the after filter. If we were using Rails we'd get the unique identifier generated automatically.</p>

<p>Before filter:</p>

<p>```ruby
require 'securerandom'</p>

<p>before do
  Thread.current[:request_id] = request.env['HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID'] || SecureRandom.hex(16)
  response['X-Request-Id'] = Thread.current[:request_id]
  @instrumentation_start = Time.now
end
```</p>

<p>After filter:</p>

<p><code>ruby
after do
  stat = (Thread.current[:stats_context] || "http.skipped.#{env["REQUEST_METHOD"]}.#{request.path_info}") + ".response_time"
  $statsd.timing(stat, ((Time.now - @instrumentation_start) * 1000).round, 1) if @instrumentation_start
end
</code></p>

<p>Note that this could, and probably <strong>should</strong>, be done in a Rack middleware like this (untested, YMMV):</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>require whatever is needed and set statsd</h1>

<p>class Stats
  class Middleware</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(app)
  @app = app
end

def call(env)
  request = Rack::Request.new(env)
  Thread.current[:request_id] = request.env['HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID'] || SecureRandom.hex(16)
  response['X-Request-Id'] = Thread.current[:request_id]
  api_client = extract_api_client_name(env)
  Thread.current[:stats_context] = "#{api_client}.http.#{request.request_method}.#{request.path_info}".gsub('/', '.')
  @instrumentation_start = Time.now

  response = @app.call(env)

  stat = (Thread.current[:stats_context] || "http.skipped.#{env["REQUEST_METHOD"]}.#{request.path_info}") + ".response_time"
  $statsd.timing(stat, ((Time.now - @instrumentation_start) * 1000).round, 1) if @instrumentation_start
  response
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Note that the stats are organized slightly differently and will read
like that:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;namespace&gt;.&lt;client name&gt;.http.&lt;http verb&gt;.&lt;path&gt;.&lt;segments&gt;.response_time
</code></p>

<p>The dots in the stats name will be used to create subfolders in graphite.
By using such a segmented stats name, we will be able to use <code>*</code>
wildcards to analyze how an old version of an API compares against a
newer one, which clients still talk to the old APIs, compare response
times, etc.</p>

<h2>Monitor time spent within a response</h2>

<p>We're collecting stats on every request so
we can see request counts and median average response times.
But wouldn't be better if we could measure the time spent in specific
parts of our code base and compare that to the overall time spent in the
request?</p>

<p>We could, for instance, compare the time spent in the DB vs Redis
vs Memcached vs the framework. And what's nice is that we could do that
per API endpoint and per API client. In a simpler case, you might decide to monitor mobile vs desktop. The principle is the same.</p>

<p>Let's hook into ActiveRecord's query generation to track the time spent
in AR within each request:</p>

<p>```ruby
module MysqlStats
  module Instrumentation</p>

<pre><code>SQL_INSERT_DELETE_PARSER_REGEXP = /^(\w+)\s(\w+)\s\W*(\w+)/
SQL_SELECT_REGEXP = /select .*? FROM \W*(\w+)/i
SQL_UPDATE_REGEXP = /update \W*(\w+)/i

# Returns the table and query type
def self.extract_from_sql_inserts_deletes(query)
  query =~ SQL_INSERT_DELETE_PARSER_REGEXP
  [$3, $1]
end

def self.extract_sql_selects(query)
  query =~ SQL_SELECT_REGEXP
  [$1, 'SELECT']
end

def self.guess_sql_content(query)
  if query =~ SQL_UPDATE_REGEXP 
    [$1, 'UPDATE']
  elsif query =~ SQL_SELECT_REGEXP
    extract_sql_selects(query)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe "sql.active_record" do |name, start, finish, id, payload|
  if payload[:name] == "SQL"</p>

<pre><code>table, action = MysqlStats::Instrumentation.extract_from_sql_inserts_deletes(payload[:sql])
</code></pre>

<p>  elsif payload[:name] =~ /.* Load$/</p>

<pre><code>table, action = MysqlStats::Instrumentation.extract_sql_selects(payload[:sql])
</code></pre>

<p>  elsif !payload[:name]</p>

<pre><code>table, action = MysqlStats::Instrumentation.guess_sql_content(payload[:sql])
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  if table</p>

<pre><code>$statsd.timing("#{Thread.current[:stats_context] || 'wild'}.sql.#{table}.#{action}.query_time",
                    (finish - start) * 1000, 1)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>This code might not be pretty but it works (<em>or should work</em>).
We subscribe to <code>ActiveSupport::Notifications</code> for <code>sql.active_record</code>
and we extract the info we need. Then we use the stats context set in
the thread and report the stats by appending
<code>.sql.#{table}.#{action}.query_time</code></p>

<p>The final stats entry could look like this:
<code>auth_api.ios.http.post.v1.accounts.sql.users.SELECT.query_time</code></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>auth_api</strong>: the name of the monitored app</li>
<li><strong>ios</strong>: the client name</li>
<li><strong>http</strong>: the protocol used (you might want to monitor thrift, spdy etc..</li>
<li><strong>post</strong>: HTTP verb</li>
<li><strong>v1.accounts</strong>: the converted uri: /v1/accounts</li>
<li><strong>sql</strong>: the key for the SQL metrics</li>
<li><strong>users</strong>: the table being queried</li>
<li><strong>SELECT</strong>: the SQL query type</li>
<li><strong>query_time</strong>: the kind of data being collected.</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see, we are getting granular data. Depending on how you setup
statsd/graphite, you could have access to the following timer data for
each stat (and more):</p>

<ul>
<li>count</li>
<li>lower</li>
<li>mean</li>
<li>mean_5</li>
<li>mean_10</li>
<li>mean_90</li>
<li>mean_95</li>
<li>median</li>
<li>sum</li>
<li>upper</li>
<li>upper_5</li>
<li>upper_10</li>
<li>upper_90</li>
<li>upper_95</li>
</ul>


<p>Instrumenting Redis is easy too:</p>

<p>```ruby
::Redis::Client.class_eval do</p>

<p>  # Support older versions of Redis::Client that used the method
  # +raw_call_command+.
  call_method = ::Redis::Client.new.respond_to?(:call) ? :call : :raw_call_command</p>

<p>  def call_with_stats_trace(*args, &amp;blk)</p>

<pre><code>method_name = args[0].is_a?(Array) ? args[0][0] : args[0]
start = Time.now
begin
  call_without_stats_trace(*args, &amp;blk)
ensure
  if Thread.current[:stats_context]
    $statsd.timing("#{Thread.current[:stats_context]}.redis.#{method_name.to_s.upcase}.query_time", 
                     ((Time.now - start) * 1000).round, 1) rescue nil
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  alias_method :call_without_stats_trace, call_method
  alias_method call_method, :call_with_stats_trace</p>

<p>end if defined?(::Redis::Client)
```</p>

<p>Using Ruby's alias method chain, we inject
our instrumentation into the Redis client so we can track the time spent
there.</p>

<p>Applying the same approach, we can instrument the Ruby <strong>memcached</strong> gem:</p>

<p>```ruby
::Memcached.class_eval do</p>

<p>  def get_with_stats_trace(keys, marshal=true)</p>

<pre><code>start = Time.now
begin
  get_without_stats_trace(keys, marshal)
ensure
  if Thread.current[:stats_context]
    type = keys.is_a?(Array) ? "multi_get" : "get"
    $statsd.timing("#{Thread.current[:stats_context]}.memcached.#{type}.query_time", 
                     ((Time.now - start) * 1000).round, 1) rescue nil
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  alias_method :get_without_stats_trace, :get
  alias_method :get, :get_with_stats_trace</p>

<p>end if defined?(::Memcached)
```</p>

<h2>Dashboards</h2>

<p>We now have collected and organized our stats. Let's talk about how to
use Graphite to display all this data in a valuable way.</p>

<p>When looking at timer data series, the first thing we want to do is create an overall represention. Your first inclination is probably an <em>average</em>.</p>

<p>The problem with the mean is that it's the sum of all data
points divided by the number of data points. It can thus be significantly affected by a small number of outliers.</p>

<p>The median value is the number found in the center of the sorted list of
collected data points. The problem in this case is that based on your
data set, the median value might not well represent the real overall
experience.</p>

<p>Neither <strong>median</strong> nor <strong>mean</strong> can summarize the whole story of your system's behavior.
Instead I prefer to use a <strong>5-95 span</strong> (thanks <a href="http://steveakers.com/">Steve
Akers</a> for showing me this metric and most of what I
know about Graphite).
A 5-95 span means that we cut off the extreme outliers above 95% and below 5%.</p>

<h3>Span</h3>

<p>Here is a comparison showing how the graphs can be different for the same
data based on what metric you use:</p>

<p><img src="/images/graphite/graphite-median_vs_mean_vs_span.png" alt="Graphite comparing median vs mean vs span" /></p>

<p>Of course the span graph looks much worse than the other two, but it's
also more representative of the real user experience and thus more
valuable. Here is how you would write the graphite function to get this data.</p>

<p>Given that we are tracking the following data-series:</p>

<p><code>
stats.timers.accounts.ios.http.post.authenticate.response_time
</code></p>

<p>The function would be:</p>

<p>```
diffSeries(stats.timers.accounts.ios.http.post.authenticate.response_time.upper_95,</p>

<pre><code>       stats.timers.accounts.ios.http.post.authenticate.response_time.upper_5)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Alias</h3>

<p>If you try that function, the graph legend will show the entire
function, which really doesn't look great. To simplify things, you can use an
alias like I did in the graph above:</p>

<p>```
alias(diffSeries(stats.timers.accounts.ios.http.post.authenticate.response_time.upper_95,</p>

<pre><code>             stats.timers.accounts.ios.http.post.authenticate.response_time.upper_5),
  "iOS authentication response time (span)")
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Aliases are very useful, especially when you share your dashboards with
others.</p>

<h3>Threshold</h3>

<p>Another neat feature you might add to your graph is a <strong>threshold</strong>.
A threshold is a visual representation of expectations. Say, for example, that your web service shouldn't be slower than 60ms server side. Let's add a threshold for that:</p>

<p><code>
alias(threshold(60), "60ms threshold")
</code></p>

<p>and here's how it would look in a graph:</p>

<p><img src="/images/graphite/graphite-median_vs_mean_vs_span-with-threshold.png" alt="Graphite with a threshold" /></p>

<h3>Draw Null as Zero</h3>

<p>Another useful trick is to change the render options of a
graph to draw null values as zero.
Open the graph panel, click on <code>Render Options</code>, then <code>Line Mode</code> and check
the <code>Draw Null as Zero</code> box.</p>

<p>Here is a graph tracking a webservice that isn't getting a lot of
traffic:</p>

<p><img src="/images/graphite/nulls_not_drawn_as_zero.png" alt="graphite example" /></p>

<p>You can see that the line is discontinued, that's because the API
doesn't constantly receive traffic. If your data series gets only very
few entries, you might not even see a line. This is why you want to
enable the <code>Draw Null as Zero</code>.</p>

<h3>SumSeries &amp; Summarize or how to get RPMs</h3>

<p>By default graphite shows data at a 10 second interval. But often
you want to see less granular data, like the quantity of requests
per second.</p>

<p>Let's say we didn't use a counter for the amount of requests, but
because we used the middleware I described earlier, we are timing all
responses. Graphite keeps a count of the timers we used, so we can use
this count value with a wildcard:</p>

<p><code>
stats.timers.accounts.*.http.post.authenticate.response_time.count
</code></p>

<p>If we were to render a graph for this stat we would see a graph per
client. Right now we only care about showing the total amount of requests.
To do that, we'll use the <code>sumSeries</code> function:</p>

<p><code>
sumSeries(stats.timers.accounts.*.http.post.authenticate.response_time.count)
</code></p>

<p><img src="/images/graphite/graphite-not-summarized.png" alt="RPMs not summarized" /></p>

<p>The graph looks pretty but it's hard to understand what kind of request
volume we are getting. We can summarize this data to show 1 min
summaries instead:</p>

<p><code>
summarize(sumSeries(stats.timers.accounts.*.http.post.authenticate.response_time.count), "1min")
</code></p>

<p><img src="/images/graphite/graphite-summarize.png" alt="RPMs summarize" /></p>

<p>We can now see the quantity of requests per minute. You could do the same to resolve by hour, day, etc.</p>

<h3>Timeshift</h3>

<p>Graphite has the ability to compare a given metric across two different time spans. For instance, let's compare
today's quantity of logins vs those from last weeks.</p>

<p>To generate today's graph:</p>

<p><code>
alias(summarize(sumSeries(stats.timers.accounts.*.http.post.authenticate.response_time.count),"1min"), "today")
</code></p>

<p>Then we use the <code>timeShift</code> function to get last week's data:</p>

<p><code>
alias(timeShift(summarize(sumSeries(stats.timers.accounts.*.http.post.authenticate.response_time.count), "1min"),"1w"), "last week")
</code></p>

<p>Graphing both series in the same graph will give us that:</p>

<p><img src="/images/graphite/graphite-timeshift.png" alt="graphite timeshift example" /></p>

<p>Wow, it looks like last week we had an authentication peek for a few
hours. Why? It would be interesting to graph our promos and sales in the same
graph to see if we can find any correlations.</p>

<p>Depending on your domain, you might want to compare against different
time slices. Just change the second <code>timeShift</code> argument.</p>

<h3>As percent</h3>

<p>Another technique is to compare the percentage growth since last week.
Let's imagine we are looking at sales or signup numbers.
We could graph today's sales per minute vs those from last week.</p>

<p>To do that, Graphite has the <code>asPercent</code> function. This function
takes a series representing <em>100%</em> and second to compare against.
The function call looks a bit scary so let me try to break it down over
multiple lines:</p>

<p><code>
asPercent(
  summarize(sumSeries(stats.timers.accounts.*.http.post.accounts.response_time.count),"1min")
  ,timeShift(summarize(sumSeries(stats.timers.accounts.*.http.post.accounts.response_time.count), "1min"),"1w")
)
</code></p>

<p>The first argument is the summarized RPMs (requests per minute) and the
second is last week's summarized RPMs.</p>

<p>Here is how the graph looks:</p>

<p><img src="/images/graphite/graphite-compare-as-percent.png" alt="graphite as percent" /></p>

<p>Based on all the data we collect, we can now graph something like that:</p>

<p><img src="/images/graphite/graphite-as-percent.png" alt="graphite as percent with multiple series" /></p>

<p>This graph is basically the same as the one above, but we used the
overall response time as the 100% value and we graphed all the different
monitored sections of our code base.</p>

<p>You can now build some really advanced tools that look at trends,
check pre- and post-deployment measurements, trigger alerts, and help you refactor your
code.</p>

<p>Maybe you suspect that your app has a chokepoint at the database level.
You can track the query types and the targeted tables per API
endpoint. You can see where you spend most of the time and which code path
is responsible for it. You can quickly see if adding indicies or other database-level techniques actually make a difference.</p>

<h2>Other tips</h2>

<h3>Share a url into campfire/irc and see a preview</h3>

<p>Campfire and many other chat tools offer image preview as long as they
detect that the url has an image extension. Unfortunately, Graphite's
graph urls look more like this:</p>

<p><code>
http://graphite.awesome.graphs.com/render?width=400&amp;from=-4hours&amp;until=-&amp;height=400&amp;target=summarize(sumSeries(stats.timers.accounts.*.http.post.accounts.response_time.count))&amp;drawNullAsZero=true&amp;title=Example&amp;_uniq=0.11944825737737119
</code></p>

<p>To get a preview, just append the with: <code>&amp;.jpg</code></p>

<h3>Get the graph data in JSON format</h3>

<p>You might want to do something fancy with the data like
create alerts. For that you can ask Graphite for a json representation
of the data by adding <code>&amp;format=json</code> to the URL.</p>

<p>```json
[
 {"target":
  "summarize(sumSeries(stats.timers.accounts.*.http.post.accounts.response_time.count))",
  "datapoints": [</p>

<pre><code>[20260.0, 137256960],[19513, 1372357020] //[...]
</code></pre>

<p>   ]
  }
]
```</p>

<p>The data points are the timestamped value of each graphed point.
Note that you can also ask for the CSV version of the data then pass it on to some poor bastard using Excel.</p>

<h3>Only show top graphs</h3>

<p>Let say that you are graphing the response time of all your APIs. The
amount of displayed graphs can be overwhelming.</p>

<p>To limit the displayed graphs, use one of the filters. For instance the <code>currentAbove</code> or
<code>averageAbove</code> filters that can help you only display web services with
more than X RPMs for instance. Using filters can be very useful to find
outliers.</p>

<h2>Get going with Graphite!</h2>

<p>Hopefully this guide will help and inspire you to start using Graphite to easily collect and analyze your metrics.
I'm sure there are great tricks I forgot to mention, please add your favorites in the comments.</p>
