I'm very glad to have had the chance to be involved with the very first
[Go](http://golang.org) challenge. My challenge is related to something we do at [Splice](https://splice.com): binary decoding.

The challenge is going on for 2 weeks until March 15, a new challenge
will be posted on April first. Prizes and conditions available on the
website. Comments and discussions available on
[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9125480)

Note that I also wrote [another challenge](https://github.com/splicers/sm-808) that we usually give our
frontend candidates. If you're not into Go and prefer JS, you might like
this challenge better.
