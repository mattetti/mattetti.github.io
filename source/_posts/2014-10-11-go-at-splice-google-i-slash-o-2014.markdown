The week of June 23rd was a good week for gophers in San Francisco. Go was a big part of Google I/O on Wednesday and Thursday, and on Monday Google run a Go SummerFest, a special instance of the GoSF meetup.

I gave a talk at Go SummerFest and then later on another one during I/O. For more
information about the events, see [this blog post from the Go team](http://blog.golang.org/io2014).
