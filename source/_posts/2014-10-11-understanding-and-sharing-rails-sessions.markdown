In September 2014, I gave this talk at [Baruco](http://www.baruco.org/)
in Barcelona, Spain. The talk focuses on:

* how session authentication works in Ruby on Rails,
* the crypto used to protect the data,
* the security implications and
* how to share the session with applications written in other languages than Ruby. (with an example in [Go](http://golang.org))

To illustrate this pretty dry topic, I told the story of Alice and Bob,
two entrepreneurs building a succesful web application and facing some serious challenges.
