I was invited to take part in this year's Docker keynote to discuss how we use Docker at Splice
and how our two companies share the same philosophy. I wrote [a summary blog post](https://blog.docker.com/2016/06/docker-for-mac-splice/) of my talk.
And you can read the official [Docker blog post about the keynote](https://blog.docker.com/2016/06/dockercon-general-session-video/)
